# `tcpdump` Command

`tcpdump` is a powerful command-line packet analyzer tool. It is useful for capturing and analyzing network traffic. Below is a list of useful options for `tcpdump`, along with explanations of the output that you may encounter.

## Basic Usage

```
tcpdump
```

This will capture packets on the default network interface.

---


```
tcpdump -i <interface>
```
Specify the interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0, etc.) on which to capture traffic.


### Useful Options

---

#### 1. Capture traffic from a specific host

```
tcpdump host <hostname or IP>
```

This will capture all packets to and from the specified host.

---


2. Capture only TCP traffic


```
tcpdump tcp
```
Captures only TCP traffic, filtering out other protocols.

---


3. Capture only UDP traffic

```
tcpdump udp
```

Captures only UDP traffic, filtering out other protocols.

---


4. Capture traffic on a specific port

```
tcpdump port <port_number>
```

This filters packets based on a specific port number (e.g., HTTP, SSH).

---

5. Save captured traffic to a file (in pcap format)
```
tcpdump -w <filename>.pcap
```
Writes the captured packets to a file for later analysis with tools like Wireshark.

---

6. Read from a previously saved file

```
tcpdump -r <filename>.pcap
```

Reads and analyzes packets from a previously saved capture file.

---

7. Capture and show DNS queries

```
tcpdump -i <interface> -n udp port 53
```
Captures DNS query traffic on the specified interface.

---

8. Capture only ICMP (ping) traffic
```
tcpdump icmp
```

Filters and captures only ICMP traffic (commonly used for ping requests).


---

9. Capture traffic from a specific subnet

```
tcpdump net <subnet/mask>
```
Filters traffic for a specific subnet, e.g., 192.168.1.0/24.

---

10. Limit capture size (capture first 100 bytes of each packet)

```
tcpdump -s 100
```

Useful when you donâ€™t need the entire packet for analysis, but only the headers.

---


11. Show packet contents in ASCII (useful for text protocols like HTTP)
```
tcpdump -A
```
Displays the packet contents in ASCII format.


---

13. Filter traffic by protocol (e.g., HTTP)

```
tcpdump 'tcp port 80'
```

Filters and captures HTTP traffic only.

---

### Combining Filters
You can combine multiple filters for more refined packet captures. For example, to capture only TCP traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and from a specific IP:

```
tcpdump tcp port 80 and host 192.168.1.100
```

---

### Best Practices
- Always use filtering to reduce the amount of captured data.
- Save long capture sessions to files (-w option) to avoid overwhelming the terminal output.
- Use short snapshot lengths (-s) when only header information is required.
Review and analyze saved captures with Wireshark for a graphical interface and advanced filtering.

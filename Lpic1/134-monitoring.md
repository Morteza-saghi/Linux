### Customizable Views:

Change display settings and sorting options via F2 (Setup).

#### Search and Filter:

Use F3 to search for specific processes.
Use F4 to apply filters to the process list.

Tree View:

Use F5 to toggle the tree view, which shows processes in a hierarchical format based on parent-child relationships.

Process Sorting:

Use F6 to choose which column to sort the process list by, such as CPU usage, memory usage, or process ID.

### Understanding Load Average in htop

The load average section in htop provides insight into the overall system load, which reflects how busy the system is over time. Understanding these values helps you gauge how well your system is handling its current workload and whether it might be under stress.
When you open htop, you'll see a section at the top that displays system statistics, including the load average. This section typically looks something like this:

```
Load average: 0.55, 0.78, 1.03
```

#### These numbers represent the system's load average over three different time intervals. Here’s what each number signifies:


```
    1-Minute Load Average:
        The first number represents the average load over the last 1 minute. This value provides a snapshot of the most recent system load.

    5-Minute Load Average:
        The second number represents the average load over the last 5 minutes. This helps smooth out short-term fluctuations and provides a view of the load trend over a slightly longer period.

    15-Minute Load Average:
        The third number represents the average load over the last 15 minutes. This value gives you an idea of the load trend over an extended period, filtering out brief spikes or dips.
```

#### What Does Load Average Mean?

    Load Average Values:
        The load average numbers are unitless but represent the number of processes that are either currently being executed or are waiting for CPU time.
        A load average of 1.00 on a single-core CPU means that the system is fully utilized, with one process actively using the CPU or waiting for CPU time.

    Interpreting Load Averages:
        Less than the number of CPU cores: If the load average is less than the number of CPU cores, the system is generally not overloaded, and the processes are handled well.
        Equal to the number of CPU cores: If the load average is equal to the number of CPU cores, the system is fully utilized. Each core is actively processing a task or waiting for CPU time.
        Greater than the number of CPU cores: If the load average exceeds the number of CPU cores, the system is under heavy load. Processes may be waiting for CPU time, which could lead to performance degradation and slower response times.

Example Scenarios



```
    Single-Core System:
        Load Average: 0.50, 0.60, 0.70
            The system is under light load and is not overwhelmed.

    Quad-Core System:
        Load Average: 3.00, 2.50, 2.00
            The system’s load is high but manageable, with each core actively processing tasks.

    Single-Core System:
        Load Average: 2.00, 3.00, 4.00
            The system is overloaded, with tasks queuing up and potential performance issues.

```

#### Additional Considerations

- High Load Average: A consistently high load average indicates that the system might be struggling to keep up with the number of processes. Investigate which processes are consuming the most resources and consider optimizing them or upgrading hardware if necessary.

- System Monitoring: Use htop along with other monitoring tools like iostat, vmstat, and free to get a comprehensive view of system performance and resource usage.

- Graphical Representation: In htop, the load average is visually represented as graphs, making it easier to see the trend over time.

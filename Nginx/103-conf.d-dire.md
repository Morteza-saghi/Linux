# Nginx Configuration: Separating Files and Resolving User Issues

### Why Split Configuration Files?
For better maintainability and clarity, it's a good practice to move domain-specific server blocks into separate configuration files. This allows you to isolate settings for each domain, making it easier to update, troubleshoot, and manage the overall configuration.


 - i used to have all the configs in the nginx.conf file so lets make that right!!

## Step 1: Splitting Domain-Specific Configuration Files
We started by separating the configuration for each domain (HTTP and HTTPS blocks) into individual files. Each file now contains the server configuration for a specific domain and is placed inside the `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` directory.

### Benefits:
- **Maintainability**: Easier to manage domain-specific settings without editing the main configuration file.
- **Isolation**: Any changes made to one domain won't affect others.
- **Troubleshooting**: Errors can be traced back to a specific file, making debugging simpler.

## Step 2: Updating `nginx.conf`
Once the domain configurations were split, we updated the main `nginx.conf` file to include the files from the `conf.d` directory.

### Key Changes:
- **Include Directive**: The main `nginx.conf` now includes all the `.conf` files from the `conf.d` directory, allowing Nginx to load configurations for each domain automatically.
- **Simplification**: The core settings (such as worker processes, connection limits, etc.) remain in `nginx.conf`, while domain-specific logic is handled separately.

#### here is a sample of nginx.conf file 

```
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;

events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type application/octet-stream;

    # Include all configuration files in the conf.d directory
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;

    sendfile on;
    keepalive_timeout 65;
    gzip on;
}
```

By splitting domain configurations into separate files and fixing the Nginx user issue, we have improved the maintainability, clarity, and robustness of the Nginx setup. The new structure isolates domain-specific configurations while the main nginx.conf remains lightweight, focusing only on core settings. Furthermore, resolving the user issue ensures that Nginx runs smoothly under the correct user on the system.

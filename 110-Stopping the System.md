# Stopping the System
key system management tasks, including halting, powering off, rebooting, and broadcasting messages. These operations ensure that you can effectively control the state of your system, communicate with users, and maintain an organized and efficient workflow.

### Halt

Usage:

```
halt
```

### Power Off

The poweroff command halts the system and then turns off the power.

```
poweroff
```

---


### Specify a Delay

schedule a delay and broadcast a message to all logged-in users


```
shutdown -h +min "the message."
Like:
shutdown -h +10 "This server will go down in 10 minutes."
```


### Schedule Power Off at a Specific Time:

Schedule the system to power off at a specific time.

```
shutdown -P 22:00
```


To cancel a scheduled shutdown or poweroff

```
shutdown -c
```

## Wall Command

wall "System maintenance in 10 minutes" 
```

The /etc/motd file contains the message of the day that is displayed to users after they log in.

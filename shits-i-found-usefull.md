## Tee

The tee command in Linux is a useful utility that reads from standard input (usually the output of another command) and writes to both standard output (the terminal) and one or more files simultaneously. 


```
ping 8.8.8.8 |tee this.file 
```

exp: this does ping and puts the outcome inside a file named this.file

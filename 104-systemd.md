# Systemd and Systemctl Commands

Systemd is a software suite that provides an array of system components for Linux operating systems. The main aim is to unify service configuration and behavior across Linux distributions. Its primary component is a "system and service manager" â€” an init system used to bootstrap user space and manage user processes.

## What is the purpose of the systemd?
systemd acts as the init system that brings up and maintains user space services when run as the first process on boot (PID 1). PID 1 is known as init and is the first Linux user-mode process created. It runs until the system shutdown. systemd owns PID 1, and is started directly by the kernel.


## lets get into the usefull commands  

#### Systemctl is the command-line tool that manages the systemd system and service manager in Linux. It lets users control and manage system services and units with commands to start, stop, restart, and check their status

---

### Check if a Service is Running

`systemctl is-active sshd`

- Sample Output: active

---

### Enable a Service to Start on Boot

`systemctl enable sshd`

Description: Enabling the SSH service with systemctl enable sshd ensures that the SSH daemon will automatically start on future boots, allowing remote SSH connections to your system.

---

### Disable a Service

`systemctl disable sshd`

Description: Disabling the SSH service with systemctl disable sshd will prevent it from starting on future boots.

---

### Checking System Status

`systemctl is-system-running`


Description: This command is used to determine the overall status of a Linux system managed by systemd. It provides a summary of the system's state.

Possible Outputs

    running: The system is fully operational and all units are active or in their desired state.
    degraded: The system is operational, but some units are not functioning correctly.
    maintenance: The system is in maintenance mode.
    initializing: The system is still in the process of starting up.
    starting: The system is in the early stages of booting up.
    stopping: The system is in the process of shutting down.
    offline: The system is offline and systemd is not managing it actively.
    unknown: The system's state cannot be determined.

## Viewing Logs with Journalctl

### View Logs for a Specific Service

`journalctl -u <service_name>`

---

### View Logs Since the Last Boot

`journalctl -b`

---

### View Logs for a Specific Service Since the Last Boot


`journalctl -u <service_name> -b`

---

### View the Last 10 Lines of Logs

`journalctl -n 10`

---

### View Logs for a Specific User

`journalctl _UID=<user_id>`

---

### View Logs from the Last Day

`journalctl --since yesterday`

---

### View Logs for a Specific Service from the Last Day

`journalctl -u <service_name> --since yesterday`

---
### View Logs from the Last Day (Alternative Command)

`journalctl -S -1d`

---

- Note: -S is the short term for --since.

---

### View Logs from the Last 10 Minutes

`journalctl --since "10 minutes ago"`


---

## View Logs for a Specific Service from the Last Hour or Minutes
For viewing logs for the SSH service (sshd):

`journalctl -u sshd --since "1 hour ago"`

---

Commonly Used Command to See Recent Logs

`journalctl -xe`

### Description: This command is commonly used to see the most recent logs created.

---

Systemd Configuration Directory

`Path: /etc/systemd/system/`

---

Note: Ensure you replace <service_name> and <user_id> with the actual service name and user ID you are interested in.

Done. Good job!

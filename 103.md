Systemd and Journalctl Command Reference

Welcome to the Systemd and Journalctl Command Reference repository! This guide provides you with essential commands to manage system services and view logs on a Linux system using systemd and journalctl.
Checking the Status of a Service

To check if a service is running, use:

bash

systemctl is-active <service_name>

Example:

bash

systemctl is-active sshd

If the service is active, you'll see the output active.
Enabling and Disabling Services
Enable a Service

To ensure that a service starts automatically on boot:

bash

systemctl enable <service_name>

Example:

bash

systemctl enable sshd

This creates the necessary symlink to start the service on future boots.
Disable a Service

To prevent a service from starting on boot:

bash

systemctl disable <service_name>

Example:

bash

systemctl disable sshd

System Status

To determine the overall status of your system managed by systemd:

bash

systemctl is-system-running

Possible Outputs:

    running: The system is fully operational.
    degraded: The system is operational, but some units are not functioning correctly.
    maintenance: The system is in maintenance mode.
    initializing: The system is still starting up.
    starting: The system is in the early stages of booting.
    stopping: The system is shutting down.
    offline: The system is offline.
    unknown: The system's state cannot be determined.

Viewing Logs with journalctl
View Logs for a Specific Service

To view logs for a particular service:

bash

journalctl -b

View Logs for a Specific Service Since the Last Boot

To view logs for a specific service since the last boot:

bash

journalctl -u <service_name> -b

Example:

bash

View the Last 10 Lines of Logs

To get the last 10 lines of logs:

bash

journalctl -n 10

View Logs for a Specific User

To view logs for a specific user:

bash

journalctl _UID=<user_id>

View Logs from the Last Day

# Systemd and Journalctl Commands

## Checking Service Status

- **To check if a service is running:**
  ```bash
  systemctl is-active sshd

Output: is active
Managing Services

    To ensure a service starts on boot:

    bash

systemctl enable sshd

Output: link created

By enabling the SSH service with 
  ```bash
systemctl enable sshd
you ensure that the SSH daemon will automatically start on future boots, allowing remote SSH connections to your system.

To prevent a service from starting on boot:

bash

    systemctl disable sshd

Systemd Configuration Directory

    The directory related to systemd configs is:

    bash

    /etc/systemd/system/

Overall System Status

    To determine the overall status of a Linux system managed by systemd:

    bash

    systemctl is-system-running

    This command provides a summary of the system's state with possible outputs:
        running: The system is fully operational and all units are active or in their desired state.
        degraded: The system is operational, but some units are not functioning correctly. This means that one or more system services have failed or are not running as expected.
        maintenance: The system is in maintenance mode, either because it was booted into rescue or emergency mode or it was manually put into maintenance mode.
        initializing: The system is still in the process of starting up.
        starting: The system is in the early stages of booting up.
        stopping: The system is in the process of shutting down.
        offline: The system is offline and systemd is not managing it actively.
        unknown: The system's state cannot be determined.

Viewing Logs with Journalctl

    To see logs related to a specific service:

    bash

journalctl -u <service_name>

To view logs since the last boot:

bash

journalctl -b

To view logs for a specific service since the last boot:

bash

journalctl -u <service_name> -b

To view the last 10 lines of logs:

bash

journalctl -n 10

To view logs for a specific user:

bash

journalctl _UID=<user_id>

To view logs from the last day:

bash

journalctl --since yesterday

To view logs for a specific service from the last day:

bash

journalctl -u <service_name> --since yesterday

To view logs from the last day (alternative command):

bash

journalctl -S -1d

Note: -S is the short term for --since.

To view logs from the last 10 minutes:

bash

journalctl --since "10 minutes ago"

To view logs for the SSH service (sshd) from the last hour:

bash

journalctl -u sshd --since "1 hour ago"

To view the most recent logs:

bash

    journalctl -xe

    This command is commonly used to see the latest logs created.

Done.
